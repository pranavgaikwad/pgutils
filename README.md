## Productivity Tools for Linux

This repository is a collection of productivity tools which I commonly use.  

Some of these tools are just plain Shell scripts, while some complicated scripts are written in Python.

Each tool has it's own directory. 

Documentation for each of the tool is available in their respective directories.
